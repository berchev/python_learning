print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

#calculating the bill+tip
bill_plus_tip = bill * (tip/100 + 1)
each_person_share = round(bill_plus_tip/people, 2)

print(f"Each person should pay: ${each_person_share}")

# Course solution:
# print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
# bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
# tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 "))
# people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
# tip_as_percent = tip / 100
# total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
# total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
# bill_per_person = total_bill / people
# final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)
# print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
